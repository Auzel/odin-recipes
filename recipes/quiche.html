    <h1>Transformed Spinach Mushroom Quiche</h1>
    <img src="../images/quiche.jpg" alt="image of quiche">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This moist vegetarian quiche is perfect for every meal. 
        The quiche was originally a quiche Lorraine, but has since been transformed. 
        Feel free to add sausage if you choose. 
        I usually make 2 large pies or several small ones all at one time, freezing whatever is left over.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 prepared 9-inch single pie crust</li>
        <li>4 eggs </li> 
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>½ (10 ounce) bag fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, sliced  </li>
        <li>½ (4 ounce) container crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>½ (8 ounce) package shredded Swiss cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li> 
        <li>Fit pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, and nutmeg in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Gently combine spinach, mushrooms, onion, and feta cheese in a separate bowl. Spread spinach-mushroom mixture in the prepared pie dish; top with half the Swiss cheese.</li>
        <li>Pour egg mixture evenly over the filling, swirling egg mixture in bowl to spread seasonings through the eggs; top the quiche with remaining Swiss cheese. Place quiche on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until the quiche is lightly puffed and browned, 45 to 50 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of the filling should come out clean. Cool for 30 minutes before serving.</li>
