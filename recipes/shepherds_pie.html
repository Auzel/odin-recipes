    <h1>Corned Beef and Cabbage Shepherd's Pie</h1>
    <img src="../images/shepherds_pie.jpg" alt="image of shepherds_pie">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a combination of my favorite corned beef and cabbage recipe, and my favorite shepherd's pie recipe. 
        It involves a few extra steps when compared to your traditional boiled beef dinner, but the payoff at the end is well worth the extra effort. 
        By layering the ingredients in a casserole dish, each serving has the perfect proportions of beef, cabbage, carrots, and potatoes.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) corned beef brisket with spice packet</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, thickly sliced</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 quarts cold water, or as needed to cover</li>
        <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 small heads Savoy cabbage, cored and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 medium carrots, thickly sliced</li>
        <li>5 large russet potatoes, quartered  </li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, cut into slices</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Irish Cheddar cheese, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped scallions, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put corned beef in a pot with onion and celery and sprinkle spice packet over top. Pour in cold water to cover. Turn heat to high and bring to a boil. Skim off and discard any foam if desired. Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer gently until tender, about 3 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Carefully remove corned beef to a bowl and let cool. Taste broth and add salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Bring broth to a boil over high heat. Add cabbage to the boiling broth. Cook until cabbage just starts to soften and sweeten up, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon and remove cabbage to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add carrots to the boiling broth. Cook until carrots start to soften, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon and remove carrots to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes to the boiling broth and reduce heat to medium. Cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are cooking, slice the cooled corned beef along the fatty seam to separate into 2 pieces. Identify the direction of the meat fibers and cut across them (against the grain) to slice into 1/4-inch thick slices, trimming off and discarding any giant pieces of fat. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 9x15-inch casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Use a slotted spoon and remove cooked potatoes to a bowl. Reserve broth. Add butter, salt, pepper, cayenne, and milk to the potatoes. Mix and mash until very smooth. Toss in 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese and mix until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Pour cabbage into the prepared casserole dish and press on it until nicely compacted. Evenly distribute and press carrots over the cabbage. Place a nice, even layer of corned beef on top, overlapping a bit and distributing the nice fatty pieces evenly until fully covered. Pour in 1 cup of the reserved broth. Dollop mashed potatoes over top, then spread into a uniform layer with the back of a spatula. Switch to a fork and push potatoes to the edge of the dish. Then drag the fork sideways back and forth over the potatoes to create a texture. Repeat this texture going top to bottom over the potatoes. Sprinkle with a little more Cheddar.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until beautifully browned and piping hot, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm any remaining broth over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Cut Shepherd's pie into squares and garnish with scallions. Serve with warmed broth.</li>
    </ol>
